**Simulate brain cells using complex biologically accurate models, with the power of multiple ZedBoards**

ZedBrain is an open hardware demo that shows the capabilities of using the Zedboard Zynq platform and Xilinx Vivado HLS tools for hardware accelerated simulations of biologically accurate artificial neuron networks. 

Computing intensive models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley's can be implemented on C or C++ and synthesized on the PL fabric of the Zynq platform for high speed performance. Multiple Zedboards connected through the TCP-IP protocol can extend simulations to networks with thousands of cells, with quick, accurate results.

## Directory structure
hls/ ------------ Source and constraints files used to generate the hardware accelerator ION IP. Vivado ver. HLS 2016.4

vivado/          ------------ TCL script used to generate all the ZedBoard project. Script was tested using Vivado 2016.4

arm_sw/  ----------- Software needed by the ZedBoard's Zynq core in order to run ZedBrain. Software implemented with the Vivado SDK 2016.4 edition.
