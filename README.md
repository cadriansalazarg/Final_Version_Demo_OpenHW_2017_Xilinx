**Simulate brain cells using complex biologically accurate models, with the power of multiple ZedBoards**

ZedBrain is an open hardware demo that shows the capabilities of using the Zedboard ZYNQ platform for hardware accelerated simulations of biologically accurate artificial neuron networks. Computing intensive models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley's can be implemented on C or C++ and syntehsized on the PL fabric of the Zynq platform for high speed performance. Multiple Zedboards connected thought TCP-IP protocols can extend simulations to thousands of neural cells with quick results.
