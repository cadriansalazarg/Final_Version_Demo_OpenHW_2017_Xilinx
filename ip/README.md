**Simulate brain cells using complex biologically accurate models, with the power of multiple ZedBoards**

ZedBrain is an open hardware demo that shows the capabilities of using the Zedboard Zynq platform and Xilinx Vivado HLS tools for hardware accelerated simulations of biologically accurate artificial neuron networks. 

Computing intensive models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley's can be implemented on C or C++ and synthesized on the PL fabric of the Zynq platform for high speed performance. Multiple Zedboards connected through the TCP-IP protocol can extend simulations to networks with thousands of cells, with quick, accurate results.

## Instructions (Last revision: 6-28-2017)

This directory contains the IP generated by Vivado HLS 2016.4

This IP was generated to run 2000 cells per ZedBoard for a system with 4 ZedBoards. So, total size of the network is 8000 cells.

You must uncompress the  ip.tar.gz file to access the ip.
