**Simulate brain cells using complex biologically accurate models, with the power of multiple ZedBoards**

ZedBrain is an open hardware demo that shows the capabilities of using the Zedboard Zynq platform and Xilinx Vivado HLS tools for hardware accelerated simulations of biologically accurate artificial neuron networks. 

Computing intensive models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley's can be implemented on C or C++ and synthesized on the PL fabric of the Zynq platform for high speed performance. Multiple Zedboards connected through the TCP-IP protocol can extend simulations to networks with thousands of cells, with quick, accurate results.

## Instructions (Last revision: 6-28-2017)

This directory contains the bitstream of a single ZedBoard running the ZedBrain system generated by Vivado 2016.4

The generated bitstream is able to run up to 2000 cells per ZedBoard for a system with four ZedBoards. So, the maximun network size that may be simulated is of 8000 cells. These sizes may be edited on project source files if a bigger platform is used

You must uncompress the "design_1_wrapper.bit.tar.gz" file to access the bitstream.
